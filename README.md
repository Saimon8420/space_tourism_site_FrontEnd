## My process

### Built with

- React Js
- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Vanilla CSS with custom properties
- FlexBox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned
This project created with vanilla CSS. It helps me to drive deep into the world of CSS.
From this project i polished some of my skills, one of them is position, with the help of CSS position property. And also i able to make modals, without any 3rd party libraries and frameworks.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

### Continued development

I will focusing on SASS in future project. still i'm not comfortable with this, so this part will be my future focusing target.

### Useful resources
